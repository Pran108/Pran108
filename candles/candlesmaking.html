       <p>The early Greeks used candles on moon-shaped "cakes" of some sort to honour the goddess Artemis's birth on the sixth day of every lunar month. 
        The tradition of putting candles on birthday cakes might be traceable to this custom</p>
        <p>Candle making was developed independently in many places throughout history. Candles were primarily made from tallow and beeswax in ancient times, 
            but have been made from spermaceti (from sperm whales), purified animal fats (stearin), and paraffin wax in recent centuries.</p>

          <p>Before you pour the wax, place your wick into the appropriate vessel. You can choose any container you want for candle the shape or you can use the empty candle container 
            that was previously used up.</p> 
           <br>

           <br> 
            You can hold the wick by using Popsicle sticks as shown in the above picture.Sandwich the wick in between so that it stays centered while the wax hardens.
        
           <p> </p>
            <li><b>Choosing and Measuring your wax </b> </li>
            <img src = "https://images.pexels.com/photos/7234513/pexels-photo-7234513.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=600" /> <br> 
            There are several different kinds of wax to choose from.You can choose any wax which you like from the above list. 
            <br> Measure the wax in weighing machine.One pound of paraffin wax by weight will equal approximately 20 oz of liquid melted wax. 
            One pound of soy wax will equal approximately 18 oz of liquid when melted. 
            One pound of beeswax by weight will equal approximately 16 oz of liquid when melted.
            
            <p> </p>
            <li> <b>Melt the wax</b></li>

            Pour the wax in double boiler. Keep stirring frequently. Meltt the wax in liquid for 10-15 minutes.

            At this stage you can add any fragrance oils like jasmine, lavendar etc. of your wish and add colours for aesthetics purpose. 
            Feel free to skip this step if you wish. If you are mixing scents use more than one bottle instead of a blend to make sure the scent comes through.

            Slowly pour the wax into your container. Hold the wick in place, but don’t pull on it. <br> Allow the wax to set for four hours at room temperature.
           
           <p> </p>
           <li><b> Cut the wick</b></li>
           trim the wick down to ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters). This will help contain the flame, as a longer wick will cause the flame to be too large.
